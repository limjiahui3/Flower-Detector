# Flower Detector

**Project Goal:** Develop a supervised object detection model using YOLO to accurately identify and localise various types of flowers in images.

## Overview

 **Models:** YOLO (You Only Look Once)

**Evaluation Metrics:** Precision, Recall, mAP50, mAP50-95

**Best Results:** Precision: 0.805, Recall: 0.815, mAP50: 0.858, mAP50-95: 0.492
